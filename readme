compilation and run:
 g++ main.cpp -std=c++14 && ./a.out


What else could be done, but I didn't?
- better encapsulation, eg. some functions from AST.h should be not visible from outside
- makefile, more than one .o  
- any polynomial. This is not that hard
- more consistient naming (variable in tokens.h means namely in parser)
and much more



log() means e-based logarithm

I'm checking against syntax errors, not mathematical errors. Eg. log(-1) is -nan. This behaviour is sometimes desirable. The same with "x=x". If user nan, inf is right float value. This is simple cli app, so user can pipe output to another program, so I prefer to always, when possible return float value, whenever it makes any sense.
